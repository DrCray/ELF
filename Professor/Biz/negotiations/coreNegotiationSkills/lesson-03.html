    <h2>Dialog: Scope, Features, or Workload</h2>
    <div class="dialog">
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> From our perspective, the project scope doesn't fully meet our needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Provider:</strong> I understand your point; however, expanding the scope would be difficult under the current agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Would it be possible to adjust the scope slightly?</p>
        <p><strong>Provider:</strong> As an alternative, we could include additional support during the final phase.</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> That could work for us, provided the overall timeline stays the same.</p>
        <p><strong>Provider:</strong> That makes sense. Let's move forward with that adjustment.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Variation:</h3>
    <div class="dialog">
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> From our side, the current project scope does not completely meet our needs. We would like to add payment processing.</p>
        <p><strong>Provider:</strong> I understand your concern. However, adding that feature would be difficult under the current fixed agreement and budget.</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Is it possible to make a small adjustment to the scope?</p>
        <p><strong>Provider:</strong> Instead, we could include extra user support and training during the launch phase at no additional cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> That could be acceptable for us, as long as the overall timeline remains the same.</p>
        <p><strong>Provider:</strong> That works. Let's proceed with the additional support included.</p>
