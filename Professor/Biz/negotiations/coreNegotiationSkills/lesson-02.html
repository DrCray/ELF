        <li>That would be difficult because of our existing commitments.</li>

        <li>We wouldn't be able to meet that deadline because of resource limitations.</li>
        <li>There's limited room for movement on delivery dates.</li>
        <li>Moving to higher specifications would pose significant challenges for our production process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dialog: Deadlines & Delivery Timelines</h2>
    <div class="dialog">
        <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> At this stage, our main concern is the delivery schedule.</p>
        <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> We're limited by our current production capacity.</p>
        <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> Could we explore whether there's room to move on the delivery date?</p>
        <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> We might be able to reduce delivery by one week; however, we wouldn't be able to go beyond that.</p>
        <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> That sounds reasonable. This would help us meet our internal deadlines.</p>
        <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> Then it sounds like we're aligned on the revised timeline.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Variation:</h3>
    <div class="dialog">
        <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> Our main concern at the moment is the delivery schedule of 8 weeks.</p>
        <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> We are limited by our production capacity right now.</p>
        <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> Is there any possibility to bring the delivery date forward?</p>
        <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> We could perhaps reduce it by one week, to 7 weeks, but we cannot do more than that because of current orders.</p>
        <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> That seems acceptable. It would help us meet our own internal deadlines for assembly.</p>
        <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> Good. Then we are agreed on the new timeline of 7 weeks.</p>
