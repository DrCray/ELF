<h2>Dialog: Equipment Rental Terms</h2>
<div class="dialog">
    <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> We can rent you the projectors for $200 per week with a four-week minimum.</p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> That sounds reasonable, if we can reduce the minimum to two weeks.</p>
    <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> We see your point; however, our standard minimum is four weeks for equipment rentals.</p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> Rather than a four-week minimum, we could commit to renting multiple units for two weeks.</p>
    <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> That could be acceptable for us. As a compromise, you can rent three projectors for two weeks at the weekly rate.</p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> That makes sense. We're aligned on three units for two weeks.</p>
</div>

<h3>Variation:</h3>
<div class="dialog">
    <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> The conference room rental is $500 per day, including basic equipment.</p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> I appreciate your flexibility; however, we need catering included in that price.</p>
    <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> Instead of including catering, what about a 10% discount if you book our catering separately?</p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> That might be viable, provided the catering discount applies to our entire order.</p>
    <p><strong>Supplier:</strong> That works for us. So we're agreed on the room rental plus 10% off catering.</p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> Excellent. That's settled then.</p>
