        <h2>At Issue</h2>
        <p>Greenmont's Mayor Vasquez has announced plans for a new Public Access Media Center to be built on the site of Oak Grove Park, sparking outrage from the community.</p>
        <h3>Scenario Overview</h3>

<p>
In the city of Greenmont, Mayor Vasquez Elena Vasquez envisions a state-of-the-art Public Access Media Center on the city-owned site: Oak Grove Park. Currently, this park features winding bricked walking paths shaded by ancient oaks; a popular BBQ pavilion with picnic tables; and a playground with swings, slides, and climbing structures. The park is used daily by families, joggers, and seniors. However, as the only city-owned space large enough to host the media center, Mayor Vasquez's design calls for the park to be completely replaced by the media center. </p>
<p> Committee Members:

   <ul><li> Mayor Vasquez</li>

    <li>Ms. Chen: City Engineer</li>

    <li>Mr. Hale: Oak Park Chairperson</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>The Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span>
Let’s get started by diving right in. While I appreciate your stance of protecting the park, Mr. Hale, you need to understand that we are going through with this Media Center project--that issue is not on the table. We have the authority, the funding, and a legal obligation to finish it, as it was mandated by city law. The only question now is about implementation.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mr. Hale:</span> We understand, Mayor. It isn’t that we want to stop the project entirely; we just don’t want it on our parkland. That park is the source of wonderful family memories going back generations. It is an integral part of who we are. Have you actually visited the park recently, Mayor?

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span> I have, actually. I know it’s a wonderful place—it’s where I go for my morning run. But what can we do? The media center must be built, and this is the only city-owned space large enough to host it.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mr. Hale:</span> With all due respect, Mayor Vasquez, I think your design is too grand. You are planning an oversized pavilion and a massive landscaped area with fountains and hedges. In the middle of all this, you want a plaza, which takes up a lot of space. Are you building a media center or replicating the Palace of Versailles?

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Ms. Chen:</span> I think Mr. Hale has a point. However, remember, Mr. Hale, that we developed these plans with the whole area in mind, not expecting resistance. From our perspective, we had a lot of space to work with.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span> I think what Ms. Chen means is that since we have the money, the space, and the authority, our plans were naturally ambitious.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mr. Hale:</span> Have you considered, Mayor, that the park itself is already a natural beauty? With the ancient oaks, the natural shade, and the original landscaping, it’s more than just a picnic and playground area. That park was planned as a thing of beauty itself, not just a simple park. It was designed so that community gattherings could be held within a place of beauty. It's not just about the space.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Ms. Chen:</span> You might be on to something there, Mr. Hale. Mayor Vasquez, the heart of the project is the media center itself—bringing information access to everyone. What if we abandon the grand plaza and the extra landscaping? We can integrate the building into the existing park. In fact we can give the park a nice facelift, adding a fountain, a flower garden, and some hedged bushes.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mr. Hale:</span> Keeping the park as-is with some added renovation would certainly be acceptable.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span> But what about the building itself? If we don't clear a large swath of the park, we won't have any space for the media center.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Ms. Chen:</span> Not necessarily. The northwest area of the park is rarely used. The overgrowth between the oaks has made the paths impassable, so people tend to avoid that section.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span> So what does that mean for the media center?

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Ms. Chen:</span> Since that part of the park isn't being maintained or used, it won't be missed if we construct there. We might have to extend somewhat into the usable area of the park, but the footprint will be smaller, maybe only 20% of the usable section of the park.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mr. Hale:</span> It's true, that section of the park has been an eyesore for years because we haven't had the budget to maintain it. Any improvement to that area would be appreciated. I can’t imagine any objections to building there.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span> But that area sits low and is tucked away in the back. We don't want our media center hidden from view.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Ms. Chen:</span> Actually, with some redesign, that won't be a problem. With the money we save by eliminating the plaza and elaborate landscaping, we can raise the elevation of that section to make it the highest point of the park. If we add a road behind it, the media center will be the most accessible and visible part of the site.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span> I like it. This is a much better plan than the original. What do you think, Mr. Hale? Would this work for your committee?

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mr. Hale:</span> Absolutely. In fact, I think the park will be more accessible and beautiful than it is now.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span> Great. Then do we have a deal?

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mr. Hale:</span> It's a deal, Mayor Vasquez. Thank you for including us in this process. I know you didn't have to.

</div><div class="dialog-line"><span class="speaker">Mayor Vasquez:</span> Oh, Mr. Hale—if I want your future votes, I certainly had to! (Everyone laughs)</div>
