    <h2>🎄 The Story of George Bailey</h2>

    <p>The setting is Bedford Falls, a small American town, in the 1940s. George Bailey is a man with big dreams. Since he was a boy, he wanted to travel the world, build giant bridges, and leave his "<strong>shabby</strong> little town" behind.</p>

    <p>However, George is a man of great <strong>character</strong>. Every time he is about to 
leave, something happens that <strong>requires</strong> him to stay and help others. When
 his father dies, George stays to run the "Bailey Building and Loan," a 
small bank that helps poor people buy their own homes. He <strong>gives up</strong> his 
college money so his brother can go instead. George is the <strong>cornerstone</strong> of the community, but he feels <strong>trapped</strong>.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>The villain of the story
 is Mr. Potter. He is a <strong>greedy</strong>, cold-hearted businessman who owns almost
 everything in town—except for George’s small bank. Potter wants to 
control the whole town and <strong>charge</strong> the poor <strong>high rents</strong>. George <strong>spends</strong> his
 entire life fighting Potter to <strong>protect</strong> the people of Bedford Falls.</p><figure class="article-image">

    </figure>

    <p>George
 eventually marries his childhood sweetheart, Mary. They have a family 
and a <strong>drafty</strong> old house. Even though he is a hero to the town, George 
still feels like a failure because he never traveled, went to college, nor became wealthy.</p>

    <div class="separator">
        <span>❄️</span><hr><span>❄️</span>
    </div>

    <p>On Christmas Eve, a <strong>disaster</strong> strikes. George’s Uncle Billy accidentally loses $8,000 of the bank’s money. If the money isn't found, the bank will <strong>collapse</strong> and George will go to prison. <strong>Desperate</strong>, George goes to Mr. Potter for help. Potter <strong>mocks</strong> him and tells him he is "worth more dead than alive" because he has a life insurance policy.</p>    <figure class="article-image">

    <p>Feeling <strong>hopeless</strong>, George stands on a bridge over a freezing river. He thinks the world would be <strong>better off</strong> if he had never been born. Just as George is about to jump, a man named Clarence <strong>shows up</strong> and <strong>tricks</strong> George and stops him from jumping to his death. Clarence tries to <strong>convince</strong> George that his life is worth living. .&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In order to convince George to live, Clarence <strong>reveals</strong> that he is an Angel.&nbsp; To make his <strong>point</strong>, Clarence shows George what the world would be like if George had never been born.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Georg and Clarence walk through the town, but it isn't Bedford Falls anymore. It is "Pottersville." Without George’s kindness, the town is a dark, greedy place full of bars and mean people. George sees that his brother died as a child because George wasn't there to save him. He sees that the families he helped are now <strong>homeless</strong> or in jail. Most <strong>painfully</strong>, he sees Mary, who is lonely and sad because she never met him.</p>

    <p>George realizes that his life—though humble—had a massive <strong>impact</strong>. He 
begs Clarence, "Please, let me live again!" Suddenly, he is back on the 
bridge. It is snowy and beautiful. George runs through the streets, shouting
 "Merry Christmas!" to everyone he passes, even Mr. Potter. He doesn't care if he 
goes to jail; he is just happy to be alive.</p>

    <p>When he gets home, 
the whole town arrives. They heard George was in trouble and they all 
<strong>donated</strong> their own small <strong>savings</strong> to help him. George realizes he is "the 
richest man in town" because of his friends.&nbsp;</p>
