But they can never take away your truth<br>
But the question is<br>
Can you handle mine?<br>
<br>
They say I'm crazy, I really don't care<br>
That's my prerogative<br>
They say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn<br>
Getting boys is how I live<br>
Some ask me questions, why am I so real?<br>
But they don't understand me<br>
I really don't know the deal about my sister<br>
Trying hard to make it right<br>
Not long ago, before I won this fight<br>
<br>
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me<br>
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)<br>
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)<br>
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)<br>
<br>
It's my prerogative<br>
It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)<br>
You can't tell me what to do<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped<br>
Ego trips is not my thing<br>
All these strange relationships really gets me down<br>
I see nothing wrong spreading myself around<br>
<br>
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me<br>
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)<br>
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)<br>
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)<br>
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me<br>
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)<br>
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)<br>
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)<br>
<br>
It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)<br>
You can't tell me what to do<br>
<br>
Why can't I live my life<br>
Without all of the things that people say?<br>
Oh, oh<br>
<br>
(Oh!) Everybody's talking all this stuff about me<br>
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)<br>
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)<br>
That's my prerogative<br>
<br>
(They say I'm crazy)<br>
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me<br>
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)<br>

I can't take direction, and my socks are never clean<br>
Teachers dated me, my parents hated me<br>
I was always in a fight, 'cause I can't do nothing right<br>
<br>
Every day I fight a war against the mirror<br>
I can't take the person staring back at me<br>
I'm a hazard to myself<br>
<br>
Don't let me get me<br>
I'm my own worst enemy<br>
It's bad when you annoy yourself<br>
So irritating<br>
Don't wanna be my friend no more<br>
I wanna be somebody else<br>
I wanna be somebody else, yeah<br>
<br>
LA told me, "You'll be a pop star<br>
All you have to change is everything you are."<br>
Tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears<br>
She's so pretty<br>
That just ain't me<br>
<br>
So doctor, doctor, won't you please prescribe me something?<br>
A day in the life of someone else<br>
'Cause I'm a hazard to myself<br>
<br>
Don't let me get me (No)<br>
I'm my own worst enemy<br>
It's bad when you annoy yourself<br>
So irritating (No)<br>
Don't wanna be my friend no more<br>
I wanna be somebody else, yeah<br>

It's bad when you annoy yourself (Yourself)<br>
So irritating (So irritating)<br>
Don't wanna be my friend no more (Don't, don't)<br>
I wanna be somebody else<br>
Don't let me get me (Don't let, don't let)<br>

It's bad when you annoy yourself (It's bad, it's so bad)<br>
So irritating (Oh)<br>
Don't wanna be my friend no more (Ahh)<br>

How you laugh when you lie<br>
You said the gun was mine<br>
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)<br>

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br>
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time<br>

Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)<br>
