        <p>
        Noun. A situation where you must choose between two options, but you can only pick one. Sometimes both options are bad, and sometimes both options are good — but either way, choosing one means giving up the other.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="answer6" class="answer" data-idx="5">
        <p>
        Noun. A complicated and confusing problem with no easy solution. Unlike a dilemma, a conundrum may involve many factors and no clear choices — just a very difficult situation to figure out.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building a new mall will create jobs and make thousands of people happy, but it means tearing down all the trees as well as destroying a neighborhood where 37 elderly people live.</li>
            <li>Your elderly parent needs daily care, but you live in a different city for work. Moving back means losing your career. Hiring a caregiver is too expensive. Bringing your parent to live with you means taking them away from their friends and their home.</li>
            <li>A city needs more housing, but every empty space is either a park that residents love or farmland that produces food. The city keeps growing, and no one can agree on the best solution for expansion.</li>
            <li>A company wants to reduce pollution from its factory, but the only way to do it would cost so much money that they would have to fire half their workers.</li>
            <li>A deadly virus is spreading fast. A government mandated lockdown would slow or stop the spreading, but cause businesses to fail, leaving people jobless and possibley losing their homes. People in lockdown will experience anxiety and depression. Keeping businesses open means the virus continues to spread, more people will die, hospitals will be overrun and medical personnel overworked. </li>
<li>A country is running out of clean water. They could build a dam, but it would flood three villages and destroy thousands of acres of farmland. They could import water, but that costs billions and makes them dependent on other countries. They could ration water, but people are already angry and protests are growing.</li>
