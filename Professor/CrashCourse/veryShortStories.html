looked over and noticed an old woman sitting at the next table. She 
stared straight ahead and never touched her coffee. Concerned, Alex 
leaned over and asked the woman if she was okay. The woman said nothing,
 stood up, and walked out the door. Alex noticed that the woman had 
forgotten her purse. He grabbed it and chased after her; but she was 
nowhere to be found. Alex looked in the purse; there was nothing 
inside.^^The King’s New Treasurer^^One day, a generous King saw a poor 
man with a broken cart, so the king sent the man a new cart filled with 
food and clothes. However, the man found a box of gold hidden in the 
cart. He went to the king to return it. The king told the man that it 
was part of a test, to see who the king could trust. He was the only man
 to return the gold, so the King appointed the man to his court and 
became the King’s new treasurer.^^The Cooking Disaster^^ Anna wanted to 
impress her family by cooking dinner. She chose a cheese casserole 
recipe. As she was preparing the ingredients, she realized she didn’t 
have enough cheddar cheese. She decided to substitute with American 
cheese and yogurt. Then, she didn’t have enough tomato sauce, so she 
substituted with ketchup. She was also surprised that her mother had no 
rice, so she substituted with spaghetti noodles. When she finally served
 dinner, she was surprised that her family loved her casserole. She 
wrote down her substitutions so she could make it again someday.^^The 
Lone Figure.^^ The small town of Campton has a grocery store, a hardware
 store, a pharmacy, a gas station, a few clothing stores, and a 
convenience store. People in this town often see a tall skinny man 
walking the streets. He is dressed in a dark gray suit, and wears a pair
 of black boots. The man never speaks to anyone as he walks around the 
town. He often comes into the shops but he never buys anything. Nobody 
knows where he lives or where he comes from. My great grandmother said 
she used to see the man when she was a little girl. She passed away ten 
years ago at the age of 96. ^^&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stuck Elevator^^ Mike was running 
late for an important meeting. He rushed into the elevator and pressed 
the button for his floor. To Mike’s horror, however, the elevator 
suddenly stopped between floors. Mike felt frustrated and pressed the 
floor buttons repeatedly, but nothing happened. He took a deep breath, 
then he pulled the red emergency button, which started ringing loudly. 
After a few minutes, the maintenance team arrived and fixed the 
elevator. Mike finally made it to his meeting, but he was embarrassed to
 walk in late. The team welcomed him with smiles, and he joked about his
 unexpected adventure.</div>
