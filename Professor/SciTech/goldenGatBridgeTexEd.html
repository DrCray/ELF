<p><em>Alex Gendler</em></p>
<h3 id="the-visionary-proposal">The Visionary Proposal</h3>
<p>In the mid-19th century, <strong>suspension bridges</strong> were <strong>collapsing</strong> <em>all across</em> Europe. Their <strong>industrial cables</strong> <strong>frayed</strong> during <strong>turbulent</strong> weather and <strong>snapped</strong> <em>under the weight of</em> their decks. So when a German-American engineer named John Roebling proposed building the largest and most expensive suspension bridge ever <strong>conceived</strong> over New York’s East River, city officials were understandably <strong>skeptical</strong>. But Manhattan was increasingly <strong>overcrowded</strong>, and commuters from Brooklyn <em>clogged the river</em>. In February of 1867, the government <em>approved Roebling’s proposal</em>.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-kind-of-bridge">A New Kind of Bridge</h3>
<p>To avoid the failures of European bridges, Roebling designed a <strong>hybrid</strong> bridge model. From suspension bridges, he <strong>incorporated</strong> large cables supported by central pillars and <em>anchored at each bank</em>. This design was <em>ideal for supporting</em> long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model also drew from cable-stayed bridges. These shorter structures <em>held up their decks</em> with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers. By adding these additional cables, Roebling <strong>improved</strong> the bridge’s <strong>stability</strong>, while also <em>reducing the weight on</em> its anchor cables.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-on-an-unprecedented-scale">Engineering on an Unprecedented Scale</h3>
<p>Similar designs had been used for some other bridges but the <strong>scope</strong> of Roebling’s plan here <strong>dwarfed</strong> them all. His new bridge’s deck <strong>spanned</strong> over 480 meters—1.5 times longer than any previously built suspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal <em>called for</em> over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand over 90 meters above sea level—<em>making them the tallest structures</em> in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<h3 id="tragedy-and-transition">Tragedy and Transition</h3>
<p>Roebling was <strong>confident</strong> his design would work, but while <strong>surveying</strong> the site in 1869, an incoming boat <strong>crushed</strong> his foot against the dock. Within a month, <strong>tetanus</strong> had <em>claimed his life</em>. Fortunately, John Roebling&#39;s son, Washington, was also a <strong>trained</strong> engineer and <em>took over his father’s role</em>. The following year, construction on the tower foundations <em>finally began</em>.</p>
<h3 id="trials-beneath-the-river">Trials Beneath the River</h3>
<p>This first step in construction was also the most <strong>challenging</strong>. Building on the rocky river bed <em>involved the use of</em> a largely <strong>untested technology</strong>: pneumatic caissons. Workers lowered these <strong>airtight</strong> wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes <em>pumped pressurized air in and water out</em>. Once <strong>established</strong>, air locks allowed workers to enter the chamber and <strong>excavate</strong> the river bottom. They placed layers of stone <em>on top of</em> the caisson as they dug. When it finally <em>hit the bedrock</em>, they filled it with concrete, <em>becoming the tower’s permanent foundation</em>.</p>
<p>Working conditions in these caissons were <strong>dismal</strong> and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, the chambers <em>caught fire</em> several times, forcing them to be <strong>evacuated</strong> and flooded. Even more dangerous was a <strong>mysterious ailment</strong> called &quot;the bends.&quot; Today, we understand this as decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be an <strong>unexplainable</strong> pain or <strong>dizziness</strong> that killed several workmen. In 1872, it nearly <em>claimed the life of</em> the chief engineer. Washington survived, but was left <strong>paralyzed</strong> and <strong>bedridden</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="a-family-s-determination">A Family’s Determination</h3>
<p>Yet once again, the Roeblings proved <strong>indomitable</strong>. Washington’s wife Emily not only <strong>carried communications</strong> between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over <em>day-to-day project management</em>. Unfortunately, the bridge’s troubles were <em>far from over</em>. By 1877, construction was <em>over budget</em> and <em>behind schedule</em>. Worse still, it turned out the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them <strong>faulty</strong> wires.</p>
<h3 id="completion-and-legacy">Completion and Legacy</h3>
<p>This would have been a <em>fatal flaw</em> if not for the <strong>abundant failsafes</strong> in John Roebling’s design. After <strong>reinforcing</strong> the cables with additional wires, they suspended the deck <em>piece by piece</em>. It took 14 years, the modern equivalent of over 400 million dollars, and the <em>life’s work</em> of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge finally opened on May 24, 1883, its <strong>splendor</strong> was <strong>undeniable</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, the Brooklyn Bridge still stands <em>atop its antique caissons</em>, supporting the <strong>gothic towers</strong> and <strong>intersecting cables</strong> that frame a <strong>gateway</strong> to New York City.</p></details>

<a href="https://youtu.be/EPd2w5d_qAk" target="_blank">audioVid Golden Gate Bridge</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="a-distant-beginning">A Distant Beginning</h3>
<p>In the mid-1930s, two familiar spires <strong>towered</strong> above the morning fog. Stretching 227 meters into the sky, these 22,000-ton towers would help <strong>support</strong> California’s Golden Gate Bridge. But since they were currently in Pennsylvania, they first had to be <strong>dismantled</strong>, packaged, and shipped <em>piece by piece</em> over 4,500 kilometers away.</p>
<p>Moving the bridge’s towers across a continent was just one of the <strong>challenges</strong> facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project&#39;s lead engineers.</p>
<h3 id="doubts-and-opposition">Doubts and Opposition</h3>
<p>Even before construction began, the pair faced <em>all kinds of opposition</em>. The military <strong>feared</strong> the bridge would make the important harbor an even more <strong>vulnerable</strong> target. Ferry companies <strong>claimed</strong> the bridge would <strong>steal</strong> their business, and residents wanted to <strong>preserve</strong> the area&#39;s natural scenery.</p>
<p>Worse still, many engineers thought the project was <strong>impossible</strong>. The Golden Gate Strait was home to 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, <strong>swirling</strong> tides, an endless <strong>blanket</strong> of fog, and the <strong>earthquake-prone</strong> San Andreas fault.</p>
<h3 id="rethinking-the-design">Rethinking the Design</h3>
<p>Despite the <strong>obstacles</strong>, Strauss was <strong>convinced</strong> the bridge could be built—and that it would provide San Francisco’s commuters more <strong>reliable passage</strong> to the city. He was, however, <em>a bit out of his depth</em>.</p>
<p>Strauss’s initial plans to <strong>span</strong> the strait used a <strong>cantilever</strong> bridge. This kind of bridge <strong>consists of</strong> a single beam <strong>anchored</strong> at one end and <strong>extended</strong> horizontally like a diving board. Since these bridges can only extend so far before <strong>collapsing</strong> under <em>their own weight</em>, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers <strong>linked</strong> by a <strong>structure</strong> in the middle.</p>
<p>But Ellis and his <strong>colleague</strong> Leon Moisseif <strong>convinced</strong> Strauss to <em>pursue a different approach</em>: the <strong>suspension</strong> bridge. Where a cantilever bridge is <strong>supported</strong> from one end, a suspension bridge <strong>suspends</strong> its deck from cables <strong>strung</strong> across the gap. The result is a more <strong>flexible</strong> structure that’s <strong>resilient</strong> to winds and <em>shifting loads</em>.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-innovation">Engineering Innovation</h3>
<p>This kind of design had <em>long been used</em> for small rope bridges. And in the 1930s, advanced steel <strong>manufacturing</strong> could create cables of <strong>bundled</strong> wire to act as <strong>strong</strong> steel rope for <strong>large-scale</strong> construction.</p>
<p>At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest suspension bridge <em>ever attempted</em>, and its design was only <strong>possible</strong> due to these <strong>innovations</strong>. But cables and towers of this size could only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast.</p>
<p>While the <em>recently completed</em> Panama Canal made it <strong>possible</strong> to ship these <strong>components</strong> to California, <em>reassembling the towers</em> <em>on site</em> <em>didn’t go quite as smoothly</em>.</p>
<h3 id="building-against-nature">Building Against Nature</h3>
<p>It was <em>relatively easy</em> to find a <strong>stable</strong>, shallow <strong>foundation</strong> for the north tower. But building the south tower <em>essentially required</em> <strong>erecting</strong> a ten-story building underwater. Since the strait’s <strong>depth</strong> <strong>prevented</strong> drilling or digging the foundations, bombs were <strong>dropped</strong> on the ocean floor, creating <strong>openings</strong> for <em>pouring concrete</em>.</p>
<p>A <strong>seawall</strong> was built to <strong>protect</strong> the site from <strong>powerful</strong> currents, and workers <strong>operated</strong> in 20-minute shifts <em>between tides</em>. The towers had so many <strong>compartments</strong> that each worker carried a set of plans to <strong>prevent</strong> <em>getting lost</em>. At <em>one point</em>, an <strong>earthquake</strong> rocked the south tower <em>nearly five meters</em> in <em>each direction</em>.</p>
<h3 id="safety-and-sacrifice">Safety and Sacrifice</h3>
<p>Strauss <em>took worker safety</em> <em>very seriously</em>, <strong>requiring</strong> <em>hard hats</em> <em>at all times</em> and <strong>stretching</strong> a <em>safety net</em> <strong>below</strong> the towers. But <em>not even these precautions</em> could <strong>prevent</strong> an <strong>entire</strong> <strong>scaffolding</strong> <strong>platform</strong> from <strong>falling</strong> in 1937, carrying ten workers to <em>their deaths</em>.</p>
<p><em>Once the towers were complete</em>, workers <strong>spun</strong> the cables <em>in place</em>, <strong>hung</strong> <strong>suspenders</strong> at 50-foot intervals, and <em>laid down</em> the <em>concrete roadway</em>.</p>
<h3 id="a-finishing-touch-the-color-debate">A Finishing Touch: The Color Debate</h3>
<p>The bridge was <strong>finished</strong>, but there was <em>still one more task</em> ahead: <strong>painting</strong> it. After <strong>production</strong>, the steel had been <strong>coated</strong> with a reddish paint <strong>primer</strong> it <strong>maintained</strong> throughout <strong>construction</strong>. But the Navy <em>had been pushing hard</em> to <strong>paint</strong> the bridge a <strong>tactical</strong> black and yellow.</p>
<p><strong>Consulting</strong> <strong>architect</strong> Irving Morrow <em>actually thought</em> the <strong>primer</strong> <em>itself paired nicely</em> with the strait’s <em>natural backdrop</em>—and <em>he wasn’t alone</em>. <strong>Citing</strong> <strong>numerous</strong> letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page <strong>pitch</strong> to <strong>paint</strong> the bridge “international orange” <em>beat out</em> the Navy’s plans.</p>
<h3 id="an-iconic-landmark">An Iconic Landmark</h3>
<p>Today, this <strong>iconic</strong> color <em>still complements</em> the strait’s blue water, green hills, and <em>rolling fog</em>—<em>serving as</em> a <strong>striking</strong> <strong>reminder</strong> of human <strong>ingenuity</strong>, <strong>perseverance</strong>, and design. </p>
