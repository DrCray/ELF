<p><em>Alex Gendler</em></p>
<h3 id="the-visionary-proposal">The Visionary Proposal</h3>
<p>In the mid-19th century, <strong>suspension bridges</strong> were <strong>collapsing</strong> <em>all across</em> Europe. Their <strong>industrial cables</strong> <strong>frayed</strong> during <strong>turbulent</strong> weather and <strong>snapped</strong> <em>under the weight of</em> their decks. So when a German-American engineer named John Roebling proposed building the largest and most expensive suspension bridge ever <strong>conceived</strong> over New York’s East River, city officials were understandably <strong>skeptical</strong>. But Manhattan was increasingly <strong>overcrowded</strong>, and commuters from Brooklyn <em>clogged the river</em>. In February of 1867, the government <em>approved Roebling’s proposal</em>.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-kind-of-bridge">A New Kind of Bridge</h3>
<p>To avoid the failures of European bridges, Roebling designed a <strong>hybrid</strong> bridge model. From suspension bridges, he <strong>incorporated</strong> large cables supported by central pillars and <em>anchored at each bank</em>. This design was <em>ideal for supporting</em> long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model also drew from cable-stayed bridges. These shorter structures <em>held up their decks</em> with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers. By adding these additional cables, Roebling <strong>improved</strong> the bridge’s <strong>stability</strong>, while also <em>reducing the weight on</em> its anchor cables.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-on-an-unprecedented-scale">Engineering on an Unprecedented Scale</h3>
<p>Similar designs had been used for some other bridges but the <strong>scope</strong> of Roebling’s plan here <strong>dwarfed</strong> them all. His new bridge’s deck <strong>spanned</strong> over 480 meters—1.5 times longer than any previously built suspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal <em>called for</em> over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand over 90 meters above sea level—<em>making them the tallest structures</em> in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<h3 id="tragedy-and-transition">Tragedy and Transition</h3>
<p>Roebling was <strong>confident</strong> his design would work, but while <strong>surveying</strong> the site in 1869, an incoming boat <strong>crushed</strong> his foot against the dock. Within a month, <strong>tetanus</strong> had <em>claimed his life</em>. Fortunately, John Roebling&#39;s son, Washington, was also a <strong>trained</strong> engineer and <em>took over his father’s role</em>. The following year, construction on the tower foundations <em>finally began</em>.</p>
<h3 id="trials-beneath-the-river">Trials Beneath the River</h3>
<p>This first step in construction was also the most <strong>challenging</strong>. Building on the rocky river bed <em>involved the use of</em> a largely <strong>untested technology</strong>: pneumatic caissons. Workers lowered these <strong>airtight</strong> wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes <em>pumped pressurized air in and water out</em>. Once <strong>established</strong>, air locks allowed workers to enter the chamber and <strong>excavate</strong> the river bottom. They placed layers of stone <em>on top of</em> the caisson as they dug. When it finally <em>hit the bedrock</em>, they filled it with concrete, <em>becoming the tower’s permanent foundation</em>.</p>
<p>Working conditions in these caissons were <strong>dismal</strong> and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, the chambers <em>caught fire</em> several times, forcing them to be <strong>evacuated</strong> and flooded. Even more dangerous was a <strong>mysterious ailment</strong> called &quot;the bends.&quot; Today, we understand this as decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be an <strong>unexplainable</strong> pain or <strong>dizziness</strong> that killed several workmen. In 1872, it nearly <em>claimed the life of</em> the chief engineer. Washington survived, but was left <strong>paralyzed</strong> and <strong>bedridden</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="a-family-s-determination">A Family’s Determination</h3>
<p>Yet once again, the Roeblings proved <strong>indomitable</strong>. Washington’s wife Emily not only <strong>carried communications</strong> between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over <em>day-to-day project management</em>. Unfortunately, the bridge’s troubles were <em>far from over</em>. By 1877, construction was <em>over budget</em> and <em>behind schedule</em>. Worse still, it turned out the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them <strong>faulty</strong> wires.</p>
<h3 id="completion-and-legacy">Completion and Legacy</h3>
<p>This would have been a <em>fatal flaw</em> if not for the <strong>abundant failsafes</strong> in John Roebling’s design. After <strong>reinforcing</strong> the cables with additional wires, they suspended the deck <em>piece by piece</em>. It took 14 years, the modern equivalent of over 400 million dollars, and the <em>life’s work</em> of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge finally opened on May 24, 1883, its <strong>splendor</strong> was <strong>undeniable</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, the Brooklyn Bridge still stands <em>atop its antique caissons</em>, supporting the <strong>gothic towers</strong> and <strong>intersecting cables</strong> that frame a <strong>gateway</strong> to New York City.</p>
