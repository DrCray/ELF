        	<p>
	In
	1990, the Italian government <b>enlisted</b> top engineers to
	<b>stabilize</b> Pisa’s famous Leaning Tower. There’d been many
	attempts to right the tower during its 800 year history, but this
	team’s computer models revealed the <b>urgency</b> of their
	situation. They <b>projected</b> the tower would topple if it
	reached an angle of 5.44 degrees— and it was currently leaning at
	5.5. No one knew how the tower was still standing, but the <b>crisis</b>
	was clear: they had to solve a problem that <b>stumped</b> centuries
	of engineers, and they needed to do it fast. 
	</p>
	<p>To
	understand their situation, it’s helpful to understand why the
	tower <b>tilted</b> <i>in the first place</i>. In the 12th century,
	the wealthy maritime republic of Pisa set about turning its
	cathedral square into a magnificent landmark. Workers <b>embellished</b>
	and enlarged the existing church, and added a massive domed
	baptistry to the plaza. In 1173, construction began on a
	free-standing campanile, or bell tower. 
	</p>
	<p>The
	engineers and architects of the time were <i>masters of their craft</i>.
	But for all their engineering knowledge, they knew far less about
	the ground they stood on. Pisa’s name comes from a Greek word for
	“marshy land,&quot; which perfectly describes the clay, mud, and
	wet sand below the city’s surface. Ancient Romans <b>counteracted</b>
	similar conditions with massive stone <b>pillars</b> called <b>piles</b>
	which rest on Earth’s stable <b>bedrock</b>. However, the tower’s
	architects believed a three-meter foundation <i>would suffice</i>
	for their relatively short structure. Unfortunately for them, less
	than five years later, the tower’s southern side was already
	underground. 
	</p>
	<p>Such
	a shifting foundation would normally have been a fatal <b>flaw</b>.
	If workers added more weight, the <b>pressure</b> from upper stories
	would sink the structure and fatally increase the lean. But
	construction halted at the fourth story for nearly a century as Pisa
	descended into <b>prolonged</b> warfare. This long pause allowed the
	soil to settle, and when construction began again in 1272, the
	foundation was on slightly more <i>stable footing</i>. 
	</p>
	<p>Under
	the direction of architect Giovanni di Simone, workers <b>compensated</b>
	for the tower’s <b>minor</b> tilt by making the next few floors
	taller on the southern side. But the weight of the extra masonry
	made that side sink even deeper. By the time they completed the
	seventh floor and bell chamber, the angle of the tilt was 1.6
	degrees. 
	</p>
	<p>For
	centuries, engineers tried numerous <b>strategies</b> <i>to address</i>
	the lean. In 1838, they <b>dug</b> a walkway around the <b>base</b>
	to examine the <b>sunken</b> foundation. But removing the supporting
	sand only <b>worsened</b> the tilt. In 1935, the Italian Corps of
	Engineers <b>injected</b> mortar to strengthen the base. However,
	the mortar wasn’t <i>evenly distributed</i> throughout the
	foundation, resulting in another sudden drop. All these failed
	attempts, along with the ever-sinking foundation, moved the tower
	closer to its <b>tipping point</b>. And without <i>definitive
	knowledge</i> of the soil <b>composition</b>, engineers couldn’t
	<b>pinpoint</b> the tower’s fatal angle or <b>devise</b> a way to
	stop its fall. 
	</p>
	<p>In
	the years following WWII, researchers developed tests to identify
	those missing <b>variables</b>. And in the 1970’s, engineers
	calculated the curved tower’s center of gravity. With this data
	and new computing technology, engineers could model how stiff the
	soil was, the tower’s <b>trajectory</b>, and the exact amount of
	<b>excavation</b> needed for the tower to remain standing. In 1992,
	the team drilled <b>diagonal</b> tunnels to remove 38 cubic meters
	of soil from under the tower’s north end. Then, they temporarily
	<b>counterbalanced</b> the structure with 600 tons of lead ingots
	before <b>anchoring</b> the base with steel cables. 
	</p>
	<p>More
	than six centuries after its construction, the tower was finally
	straightened… to a tilt of about four degrees. No one wanted the
	tower to fall, but they also didn’t want to lose the landmark’s
	most famous <b>feature</b>. Today the tower stands at 55– or 56–
	meters tall, and it should remain <b>stable</b> for at least 300
	years as a monument to the beauty of imperfection.</p>
